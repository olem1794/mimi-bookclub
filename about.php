        <h2>The Parlour</h2>
        <p>While most of our club activities are held digitally, we do offer a physical location for book lovers who want a comfortable space to enjoy their books, a cup of tea and perhaps the opportunity to meet fellow readers in the real world. We offer a tea and coffee shop with a spacious garden, alongside an indoor lounge full of comfy cushions. Friday and Saturday nights are up for a special treat, when we light up our fairy lights and the shop doubles as a night bar. </p>

        <h2>The Book Club</h2>
        <p>The book counts with several activities throughout the month, raging from debates, quizzes, reviews and much more. Each month, the club chooses a book themed according to the current time (e.g. October is for mystery and thriller!). Members then engage in friendly, literary discussion about the latest pick on the Monthly Meeting, held the last Saturday of every month. Regardless, everyone is encouraged to make their own list and reserve books from our shelves to read at their own pace, and perhaps share them in one of our free reading gatherings.</p>

          <h2>The Founder </h2>
          <p>Mikaela Allistar set out to create a community of booklovers that could merge both the physical and digital world. Having already ventured in the business sector with her popular tea shop, Mikaela decided to expand her space to welcome another one of her obsessions, books. Thus providing a space where people could gather and enjoy each other’s company alongside a warm (or cold!) cup of tea and a great read. </p>
